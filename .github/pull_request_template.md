# How to Create a Pull Request

**Before you submit:**

- **Title Format:**  
  Your pull request title must start with a tag in square brackets that indicates the type of change. For example:
    - `[RELEASE] Your release title here`
    - `[BUG_FIX] Description of bug fix`
    - `[FEATURE] Description of new feature`
    - `[DOCS] Description of documentation update`

- **PR Body:**  
  **Do not fill out the pull request body manually until the PR has been published or drafted.**  
  The automated process will generate the PR body based on a corresponding template file from the `.github/pr_templates/` directory once the pull request is drafted or opened.

*Please ensure your title follows these guidelines so that the correct template is applied automatically.*
